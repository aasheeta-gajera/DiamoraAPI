1️⃣Cost Per Carat Calculation
Formula:

Cost Per Carat = Purchase Price / Size (Weight in Carats)
 
Given Data:

Purchase Price = $4800 (per diamond)
Size = 1.8 carats
Cost Per Carat = 4800/  1.8 = 2666.67

So, the Cost Per Carat is $2666.67.

2️⃣ Total Purchase Price Calculation
Formula:

Total Purchase Price = Purchase Price * Total Diamonds

Purchase Price (per diamond) = $4800
Total Diamonds = 40
Total Purchase Price = 4800 * 40 = 192000

So, the Total Purchase Price is $192,000.
